## 🛠 Experience

### **Sr. Software Engineer – DNS Infrastructure, LinkedIn**  
*Jan 2024 – Present*

- Developed a DNS client to provide observability for all DNS requests across 400K+ hosts. It enabled effective DNS infra alerting and opened up security analysis projects.
- Broke down regulations to code and processes, as I translated DNS RFC compliance requirements into tests and testable specs within CI/CD pipeline.
- Used system profiling tools to ensure the process meets sub-millisecond latency and strict CPU, and memory utilization limits.
- See our blog post for more details: https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/infrastructure/building-a-resilient-dns-client-for-web-scale-infrastructure.

### **Software Engineer – Traffic Engineering, LinkedIn**  
*Feb 2022 – Dec 2023*

- Maintained a Software Defined Network controller, that managed 50 backbone devices.
- Expanded configuration management component to provide drift detection service, and a
high-level interface for operators to manipulate the network topology.
- Developed judgment in choosing the right scope for tests — from single-host, single-process to full multi-process, hardware-integrated scenarios.
- Developed techniques to progressively prototype features with minimal overhead. Unit tested with mocked RPC interfaces and device dependencies. Containerized 20+ micro-services to run integration tests on a single development host. And configured physical test labs with real devices and traffic generators to run end-to-end tests.

## 🧪 Additional Experience

### **Research Assistant – WiFire, San Diego Supercomputer Center**  
*Apr 2019 – Mar 2020*

- Reduced operational load for researchers through infrastructure abstraction.
- Built a user-facing interface to specify parameters and dynamically containerize +
deploy ML workloads.

### **Project Lead – FlapJS WebApp**  
[github.com/flapjs/webapp](https://github.com/flapjs/webapp)  
*Jan 2020 – Dec 2021*

- Led team of 6 to develop automata analysis tools used by 50+ students per term.
- Converted research protocols into software and infrastructure: recruited participants, wrote test scripts, and managed data collection and analysis.

### **Computer Science Tutor – UC San Diego**  
*2019–2021 (3 terms)*

- Taught Discrete Math, Data Structures, and Software Engineering classes.
- Collaborated with the instructional team to coordinate a class of 200+ students.
- Led discussion sections, resolved student misconceptions, designed examples to demonstrate abstract concepts, and assessed homework.
